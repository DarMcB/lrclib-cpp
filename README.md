Pewdiepie Bitch Lasagna
[00:01.62] I don't like you, T-Series
[00:04.52] Nothing personal, kid
[00:07.34] But I must go all out
[00:10.18] Just this once
[00:12.74] Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
[00:15.68] Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea
[00:19.44] You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
[00:22.04] But you India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
[00:25.29] When I'm through with you, we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
[00:28.59] 'Cause we only just begun
[00:29.85] I review you, zero, bye bitch, gone
[00:32.25] So come on, T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
[00:35.92] Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna
[00:38.43] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:41.66] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[00:44.85] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:47.95] Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
[00:51.10] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[00:54.36] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[00:57.60] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:00.89] T-Series just wet themselves in their pyjamas
[01:03.76] So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
[01:07.29] I'm a blue eyes white dragon while you're just dark magician (oof)
[01:10.27] You got a fifth of the population in your nation but
[01:13.52] I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (oops)
[01:16.72] Motu-Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
[01:20.07] Your language sounds like it came from a mumble-rap community
[01:23.26] No, papa, no, papa, yes, papa, Johnny
[01:26.14] Now down a load of sugar and let's throw this fucking party with some...
[01:29.56] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:32.71] Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
[01:36.06] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:39.18] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[01:42.56] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:45.65] Look at T-Series, they just wettin' their pyjama
[01:48.83] Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
[01:51.94] T-Series ain't nothing, but a bitch lasagna
[01:55.00] You got a population of one point three-two billion
[02:01.28] But most your videos can't seem to get even a million
[02:07.84] Sub-bot!
